==THE IMPLEMENTATION FACTORY==

The Implementation Factory is a hobby project of mine where I attempt to re-implement
library functions, data structure, and algorithm functionality on my own. The project will
be using several different languages, most prominently C and Python.

I plan for all of the different files to be able to be run alone with little to
no dependencies, so people can download them individually and play around with them 
if they wish!
